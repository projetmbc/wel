[W]indows [E]asy [L]auncher
===========================

This tiny project contains a `batch` file `main.bat` and a configuration file `config\aliases.txt` so as to easily open `atom` in a wanted directory, or with a wanted file *(this project is useful because Windows console doesn't offer an easy way to define alias commands)*.

**Note:** the way `atom` works with directories is very nice because the editor keeps in memory an individual session associated to each directory.



How to use it ?
===============

1. You must add each paths of the directories and files you want to launch easily in the file `config\aliases.txt`. Just put one path by line, each path being a long version one. You can update `config\aliases.txt` every time you need.

2. To launch easily `atom`, just launch the batch file `main.bat` by clicking on it. A menu will help you to choose the good directory or file you want.
